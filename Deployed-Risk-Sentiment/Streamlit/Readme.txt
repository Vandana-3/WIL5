This is the latest multi-paage deployed model (https://regulatoryapp.streamlit.app/), it has Risk Analysis, Sentiment Analysis and Tableau scripts.

Notes: 
      1) RiskAnalysis.py is the main page, other pages are inside /pages folder
      2) Wherever this code is deployed, the path to import the model should be changed and adjusted accordingly.
